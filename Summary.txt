	- Azure Artifacts is a repository for hosting artifacts, such as compiled source code
	- Azure Test Plans is an automated test tool
- -Suppose you need to test a new feature on an old version of an operating system. Azure DevTest Labs can set up everything automatically upon request.
-Azure PowerShell is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac, and you can access it in a web browser via Azure Cloud Shell.for windows background 
-- the Azure CLI is almost identical to Azure PowerShell in what you can do with it.  The primary difference is the syntax you use . more linux background 
- ARM templates - Azure Resource Manager templates is verified before any code is executed to ensure that the resources will be created and connected correctly. Use for Automation of proceesses .you can describe the resources you want to use in a declarative JSON format

- Azure Advisor  - when you're looking for an analysis of your deployed resource and recommendations. areas where it provide recommendation are 5 - cost ,security ,performance ,reliablity ,operational excellence .Identity idle and underutilised resource .
- Azure Monitor (related to resources ) -if you want to keep track of the performance or issues related to your specific VM or container instances, databases, your applications, and so on
- Azure Service Health ( related to service ) - You can view the current status of the Azure services you rely on, upcoming planned outages, and services that will be sunset. After an outage, Service Health provides official incident reports, called root cause analyses (RCAs)


-Azure Security Center - Can monitor ,automate ,recommend ,detect ,block ,use ml to do such . Workflow automation uses Azure Logic Apps and Security Center connectors.provide just-in-time(JIT) ensuring that the network only allows traffic that you require at the time that you need it to.

- Conditional Access - It is a tool that Azure Active Directory uses to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals. These signals include who the user is, where the user is, and what device the user is requesting access from.To use Conditional Access, you need an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license
-Role assignment is a combination of role definition(what can you do)  , security principle(who can do it)  and scope(where can yo do it) 
- The role can  be assigned on any level i.e. resource ,resource group , subscription or management group .its hierarchical
- you manage access permissions on the Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal

- Cost Affecting Factors 
	- Resource Type 
	- Services 
	-Location 
	-Bandwidth 
-Cost Reduction Methods 
	-Reservation - we reserve the resource for a particular time(1 or 3 YEARS) and get discount .
