COMPUTE SERVICES 

VM 
-When you need total control over an operating system and environment, VMs are an ideal choice. Just like a physical computer, you can customize all the software running on the VM. This ability is helpful when you're running custom software or custom hosting configurations.
-You can create and provision a VM in minutes when you select a preconfigured VM image.  An image is a template used to create a VM. These templates already include an OS and often other software, like development tools or web hosting environments
- you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery. If a primary datacenter fails, you can create VMs running on Azure to run your critical applications and then shut them down when the primary datacenter becomes operational again.
- VMs are also an excellent choice when you move from a physical server to the cloud (also known as lift and shift).


Virtual machine scale sets
- Virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs.
- Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes to provide highly available applications
-  it's easier to build large-scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized workloads. As demand goes up, more VM instances can be added. As demand goes down, VM instances can be removed.

Azure Batch 
-Azure Batch enables large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) batch jobs with the ability to scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of VMs.
-Azure Batch is a Platform as a Service offering that has an entire plaform for scheduling, submitting tasks and obtaining their results
- for situations in which you need raw computing power or supercomputer-level compute power



App Service 
-  platform as a service (PaaS) environment allows you to focus on the website and API logic while Azure handles the infrastructure to run and scale your web applications 
- Endpoints can be secured.Sites can be scaled quickly to handle high traffic loads.
-The built-in load balancing and traffic manager provide high availability.
- it can host contrainers too 

Containers Instances/Azure Kubernetes 
- If you want to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine, containers are an excellent choice.
- Containers are lightweight, virtualized application environments .an
-. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host
- Unlike virtual machines, you don't manage the operating system for a container.
- VMs virtualise the hardware while containers virtualise the OS.
- Containers are managed through a container orchestrator
- One of the most popular container engines is Docker, which is supported by Azure.
- Container Instances and Azure Kubernetes Service are Azure compute resources that you can use to deploy and manage containers. 
-Containers are often used to create solutions by using a microservice architecture. This architecture is where you break solutions into smaller, independent pieces


Serverless Computing 

- With serverless computing, Azure takes care of managing the server infrastructure and the allocation and deallocation of resources based on demand.
- Serverless computing is an excellent fit for workloads that respond to incoming events or else it just idle 
- Instead of writing an entire application, the developer authors a function, which contains both code and metadata about its triggers and bindings.Triggers define how a function is invoked. Bindings provide a declarative way to connect to services from within the code.
- With serverless computing, they pay only for the time their code runs. If no active function executions occur, they're not charged. 

- Azure has two implementations of serverless compute:
	Azure Functions: Functions can execute code in almost any modern language.
	Azure Logic Apps: Logic apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered                           by Azure services without writing any code.

Azure Functions
- Functions are ideal when you're concerned only about the code running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure. 
-Using a virtual machine-based approach, you'd incur costs even when the virtual machine is idle. With functions, Azure runs your code when it's triggered and automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished
-Functions can be either stateless or stateful. When they're stateless (the default), they behave as if they're restarted every time they respond to an event. When they're stateful (called Durable Functions), a context is passed through the function to track prior activity.
-Can run locally or in the cloud.
- ideal for hosting application with unpredictable workload demands .

Azure Logic Apps 
- Where functions execute code, logic apps execute workflows that are designed to automate business scenarios and are built from predefined logic blocks.
- Stateful
-Runs only in the cloud.

Functions and Logic Apps can both create complex orchestrations. An orchestration is a collection of functions or steps that are executed to accomplish a complex task.
- With Functions, you write code to complete each step.
- With Logic Apps, you use a GUI to define the actions and how they relate to one another.


Azure Virtual Desktop (VDI)
- It enables your users to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices like Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux.
- They use a Azure Virtual Desktop client to connect to their published Windows desktop and applications. This client could either be a native application on the device or the Azure Virtual Desktop HTML5 web client.
-User sign-in to Azure Virtual Desktop is fast because user profiles are containerized by using FSLogix. At sign-in, the user profile container is dynamically attached to the computing environment. The user profile is immediately available and appears in the system exactly like a native user profile.
-Azure Virtual Desktop provides centralized security management for users' desktops with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can enable multifactor authentication to secure user sign-ins. You can also secure access to data by assigning granular role-based access controls (RBACs) to users. 
- Azure Virtual Desktop lets you use Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, the only Windows client-based operating system that enables multiple concurrent users on a single VM.


NETWORKING SERVICES 

Virtual Network (V-net)
-IaaS
- Azure virtual networks enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers
- Filter network traffic and provide security 
- Virtual Network allows you to create multiple isolated virtual networks or subnets. When you set up a virtual network, you define a private IP address space by using either public or private IP address ranges. You can divide that IP address space into subnets and allocate part of the defined address space to each named subnet.
- depends on region 

- You'll want to enable Azure resources to communicate securely with each other. You can do that in one of two ways:
	- Virtual networks 
	- Service endpoints - This approach enables you to link multiple Azure resources to virtual networks to improve security and provide optimal routing between resources.

- you can create a network that spans both your local and cloud environments. There are three mechanisms for you to achieve this connectivity:
	- Point-to-site VPN(virtual private network) : In this case, the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to connect that computer to the Azure virtual network
	- Site-to-site VPN - A site-to-site VPN links your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network. The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.
	- Azure ExpressRoute For environments where you need greater bandwidth and even higher levels of security, Azure ExpressRoute is the best approach. private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet.ExpressRoute does provide private connectivity, but it isn't encrypted.

-  You also can control routing and override those settings, as follows :
	- Route tables - A route table allows you to define rules about how traffic should be directed. You can create custom route tables that control how packets are routed between subnets.
	- Border Gateway Protocol - BGP works with Azure VPN gateways or ExpressRoute to propagate on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks

- Azure virtual networks enable you to filter traffic between subnets by using 
	 - Network security groups -  an Azure resource that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. You can define these rules to allow or block traffic, based on factors such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.
	- Network virtual appliances - A network virtual appliance carries out a particular network function, such as running a firewall or performing wide area network (WAN) optimizationx

- You can link virtual networks together by using virtual network peering or VPN Gateway . Peering enables resources in each virtual network to communicate with each other. These virtual networks can be in separate regions, which allows you to create a global interconnected network through Azure

- When you set up a virtual network, you define the internal address space in Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) format.We can't have overlapping address . Eg -  10.0.0.0/24  - this address space range from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.254. You can add address spaces after you create the virtual network.
	Within each virtual network address range, you can create one or more subnets that partition the virtual network's address space. 

- VPN - Virtual Private Network is used to connect two or more trusted private networks.Eg- A VPN that connects your East Coast offices to your West Coast servers allows your company to securely access your private customer data.
	
- VPN Gateway - A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that is used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet.
	You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network, but you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, which includes other virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.
	When you deploy a VPN gateway, you specify the VPN type: either policy-based or route-based. 
	- Policy Based - specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel . Use of static routing
	- Route based -   preferred connection method for on-premises devices. They're more resilient to topology changes such as the creation of new subnets.use dynamic routing protocols

- You'll need these Azure resources before you can deploy an operational VPN gateway
	- Virtual network.
	- GatewaySubnet- Deploy a subnet called GatewaySubnet for the VPN gateway. Use at least a /27 address mask to make sure you have enough IP addresses in the subnet for future growth
	- Public IP address.- This IP address is dynamic, but it won't change unless you delete and re-create the VPN gateway.
	- Local network gateway - Create a local network gateway to define the on-premises network's configuration, such as where the VPN gateway will connect and what it will connect to
	- Connection. Create a connection resource to create a logical connection between the VPN gateway and the local network gateway.You can create multiple connections.
 

- ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection with the help of a connectivity provider .Built-in redundancy in every peering location for higher reliability.QoS support for Skype for Business.
- Info needed to proceed - Layer 2 (L2): This layer is the Data Link Layer, which provides node-to-node communication between two nodes on the same network.
Layer 3 (L3): This layer is the Network Layer, which provides addressing and routing between nodes on a multi-node network.
- ExpressRoute supports three models that you can use to connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft cloud:
	- CloudExchange colocation -  can normally offer both Layer 2 and Layer 3 connections between your infrastructure ,which might be located in the colocation facility, and the Microsoft cloud
	- Point-to-point Ethernet connection - provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity between your on-premises site and Azure
	- Any-to-any connection -  you can integrate your wide area network (WAN) with Azure by providing connections to your offices and datacenters.all WAN providers offer Layer 3 connectivity

-  ExpressRoute uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol. BGP is used to exchange routes between on-premises networks and resources running in Azure. This protocol enables dynamic routing between your on-premises network and services running in the Microsoft cloud.
- Content Delivery Network (CDN) - allows you to geographically cache and distribute high-bandwidth content, such as streaming videos, to users in different parts of the world. 
	- Delivers web contents to user ,minimize latency by using points of presence(pop) location 
	
-Azure Loadbalancer - for even trafic distribution ,alows high availablity and scalability .
-Application gateway -loadbalncer for web traffic i.e HTTPS . Have firewall ,routing
